# Stranger Calc

---

### Project:

This is a double skinned calculator made in accordance with the Free Code Camp front end libraries path.
I made this just in time for Spooky Season, because even your calculator should be appropriately spooky. 

### The Problem:

* Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks/.

* Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* Must be aesthetically pleasing and use a library, in my case, React + Vite. 

### Who am I?

I am a Software Developer and marketing specialist out of Connecticut open to new roles.

### Technologies Used:

HTML5, CSS3, Typescript, React, and Vite
